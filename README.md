# Upcoming Games

View release dates and other info for every video game ever made. Keep track of your favorite and most anticipated games easily. Database updates itself periodically using WorkManager.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository, grab an API key from [here](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/), locate `constants.kt`, and insert the API key as the value of `GIANT_BOMB_API_KEY`.

Note that the app will still work without an API key, but the database will never update and you'll see an "Update failed" message at the top of the screen.

## Built With

* Kotlin, MVVM, Room, Retrofit, Paging Library, WorkManager, Navigation Component, Kotlin Coroutines, Moshi, Glide, Guava
